The creator behind this blog
is no more than your average joe
that just happens to think
he knows better.
So basically your average joe.

I'm a bad programmer
that typically spends his time
encoding video
for anime fansub releases.
I keep myself busy with other things,
but most posts you will find here
relate to either
video encoding
or fansubbing.

The base blog has been taken
from [Moon](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Moon).
Some parts of the pages are
~~shamelessly~~ stolen from [Blankaex's blog](https://github.com/blankaex/blog).
My avatar was made by [松下ゆう](https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=14239),
who just makes
the cutest F/GO comics.
Favicon is done by [CHANxCO](https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=35693),
and the header
on this page
is done by [じゃこ](https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=10612512).
