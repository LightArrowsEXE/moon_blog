One of the more advanced parts of games with a lot of playable characters or classes is the idea of "generalists" and "specialists". Being aware of those two terms will aid in building teams and specific setups, and allow you to think a bit deeper about *why* some characters fit so well in specific roles.


For starters, let us properly define the terms used in this piece:

**Generalists** are units that are applicable in most situations. They are useful in practically any situation, and thus will always have a place in team composition. For all intents and purposes, they fill the role of the jack of all trades, masters of none.

**Specialists** are far more specific. They have roles that are very specifically designed around performing one task very well. This makes them very strong when the situations align perfectly, and thus are a bit more gimmicky than the generalists.

Now, let's relate this to Fate/Grand Order and figure out how this plays into picking your Servants.


A vital part of Fate/Grand Order is *team building*. Every quest you run is going to be different, so having a varied set of tools available is key to playing this game. Take for example this team I built here:

{% capture images %} {{ site.url }}/assets/res/2019-09-12-generalists-and-specialists-in-FGO/MatTeam.png {% endcapture %} {% include gallery images=images %}

The quest I am doing here is the 40AP Rider Daily Quest. This quest features three waves laid out like this:

*Wave 1:*
Wyvern (total: 3) <br>
*Wave 2:*
Wyvern, Centaur, or Shadow Servants (total: 3) <br>
*Wave 3:*
Wyvern, Centaur, Shadow Servant or Regular Servant, Marie Antoinette (total: 2)

For this teambuild, I've settled on my usual combination: two generalists, one specialist.

Nitocris is a general trash mob killer/tank. With the right setup, she can use her Noble Phantasm twice in a row, allowing you to effectively clear two whole waves of trash mobs regardless of class or health. Most quests follow a similar format to the one we're running here, and thus Nitocris is a generalist that can be slotted into almost any team and retain her general purpose.

Jack the Ripper is a boss killer. Her Noble Phantasm has an additional multiplier for *female* targets, which Marie Antoinette falls under. Seeing as Marie is also a Rider, that means Jack gets class advantage against her. Her being so specialized for female Rider slaying is what makes her a good slot in for this particular quest.

Waver is a support Servants. He offers a variety of buffs, Noble Phantasm charge, and his Noble Phantasm can drain charge from enemies, stun them, lower their defense, and curse them. He is a very general support, and arguably the best in the game in that regard. It is often argued that not slotting him in at all times is akin to purposefully making it harder on yourself. He is a generalist.

The idea is simple: Nitocris can deal with the first two waves if I give her a Kaleidoscope. Jack can easily deal with Marie and whatever additional enemy appears. Waver gives them charge so they don't have to worry about charging on their own, and allows for a simple 3-turn clear.

Now, this system is by no means perfect for a game such as Fate/Grand Order. One could argue that Jack is a generalist Assassin, since she offers more general utility than just slaying bosses. She is the best *crit star generator* bar none, and offers additional utility in the form of buff removal and a short-cooldown heal. Depending on what you have available to you, she might be the best Servant to you for most generalist tasks. And this is where the whole idea of generalists and specialists, admittedly, kinda falls apart.


But let's say you have every Servant available to you, at their max strength and level, and you wish to build teams effectively. In cases like that, keeping track of the whole generalists and specialists idea will help you gain a better understanding on when a Servant should be picked over another.

As a rule of thumb, I usually build teams with either five specialists and one generalist, or four generalists and two specialists. Here is an example of a team like that, which I used during the vast majority of [Nerofest Challenge Quests](https://fate-go.cirnopedia.org/quest_event_us_20190829.php#exhibition2016):

Now, if you are familiar with any of these Servants, you might wonder which ones are the specialists, and which ones are the generalists. So let's break them down!

We need only look at the frontline to get my greater point across. In the frontline we're running BB, Amakusa Shirou, and Merlin. BB and Merlin are the supports, Amakusa is the attacker. The key here is that BB and Amakusa can be classified as either specialist or generalist depending on how they are used and how your team is built (whilst Merlin is a generalist).

BB has a heal, debuff removal and prevention, lacks any kind of common class disadvantage, and can help stall by stunning an opponent. However, she also has an offensive Noble Phantasm and a skill that increases her crit star gather rate and crit damage, allowing her to do some heavy damage, refund her Noble Phantasm faster, and dish out even more damage.

Amakusa Shirou is a very strong offensive Servant for Challenge Quests because of his gimmick: his Noble Phantasm strips all buffs from every opponent, and it does that *before* it deals damage. This means your Noble Phantasm will never be blocked. Besides that he also enjoys being part of the Ruler class, which not only has an increased attack modifier, but is also naturally tanky due to their resistance against all the common classes. As additional utility, he offers a stun and passive star generating.

Depending on how you build your team, some Servants can fit both roles pretty effectively. In this situation, I'm using BB as a specialist. She is there to help keep my main offensive Servant healthy, and be a general nuisance when she has to with her stun, buying me more time to set up. Amakusa Shirou takes on a more generalist approach, but for Challenge Quests one could also argue he is more of a specialist. His ability to strip buffs from enemies is tremendously strong for quests like these where the enemies will constantly be buffing themselves. He also offers additional stall potential with his Servant-only stun, and has effectively twice the health he actually does, making him tanky enough to live for a very long time.

Whether a certain Servant fills a generalist or a specialist role is heavily dependant on what options you have, what quest you are taking on, and how you build your team. This does, however, not mean that every Servant can fit both roles. Some simply fit well on any kind of team irregardless of the quest, and others have very specific skillsets that only allow them to work properly in certain situations.

With this kind of knowledge, building teams should become a lot easier. If you research the quests you take and how the Servants you run tick, you can elegate their roles to fit what you need in your current setup and have an easier time on the battlefield.

This post took heavy inspiration from [FUNKe's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UiVtTR4aMY) on specialists and generalists in Team Fortress 2. Despite being completely different games featuring a completely different kind of class system, there are ways to view them similarly, which is what I attempted to do here.

At the end of the day, a lot of it comes down to learning your Servants' strengths and weaknesses well, and being prepared for the quests that are to come. Do your research, build a lot of teams, and you will slowly learn how every gear functions in a fluid team.
