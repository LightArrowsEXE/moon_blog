Everyone has to start somewhere. You pick up your first (weekly) show, and you hammer at it until you finally get something you’re happy with. For some people this is a positive experience, for others negative, and then there’s the in-betweens like me.

As an introduction, I am the project leader, encoder, and editor for the [Kaleido-Flax Kimetsu no Yaiba] release. As of this post, we have done up to episode 18, with episode 19, 20, and 21 being in the works. For many of us in there, it’s one of our first seasonal projects, and yet we decided to embark on the treacherous road that everyone has to traverse at one point or another.

Kimetsu no Yaiba was one of those unfortunate shows that ended up with Aniplex subtitles. This means every other line sounded very flat, uninteresting, and in some cases was flat-out wrong. Since this was my first proper editing job, I probably couldn’t have had a worse script to start out with.

Our typesetter(s) had some experience, but luckily for them Kimetsu no Yaiba is by no means a sign-heavy show (that is, until you have to typeset some eyes). The timer was very experienced, and guided us a lot along the way.

That left me and the translator that kinda got thrown into the deep. Despite starting out rocky, I feel like we’ve started figuring out each other’s styles, strenghts, and weaknesses by now. When both of us are in our element, I don’t feel the script ends up that bad. Granted, I don’t speak Japanese. I can’t tell how accurate it is, so others may see it differently.

Encoding, which is more my forte anyway, was the same as usual. Dealing with bad web-sources is always fun, and Kimetsu no Yaiba is by no means different. Dehardsubbing is a pain as usual whenever they decide to throw in a sign, and not murdering everything and get an acceptable filesize is also a reason why I suffer sometimes. Other than that, not too bad.

As for my opinion on Kimetsu no Yaiba, I’d say it’s so-so. The show has some high points, but it also has some very, very low points. The story can get rather boring and tropey sometimes, and whilst I don’t think any of the characters are particularly interesting (other than Inosuke, who’s just so dumb and I love it), they’re not boring enough to not get me invested in the plot when it really matters. Episode 19 is a fantastic example of this, and I can’t wait to bring that one out.

Now, the most important part of this post: my experience. Overall, I’d say it’s mixed. I had a lot of fun working with these people, and I would love to work with them on another show again one day. I can see this being a very fun experience if we had a better base script to work off of, and a show I enjoyed more than I did. I know that this is a "no fun allowed" zone, but I’m a guy with severe motivation issues. If I lose interest, my output will be low and bad. I lose motivation quickly. This is what makes me, in my utmost honest opinion, a bad editor.

That being said, if I worked with the same people again, I can see the experience being far more positive. Let’s hope I can con them into a show I won’t regret picking up again some other season. With a bit of luck, this post will be updated by the end and feel more like a proper blogging post rather than a guy that just randomly vomited his thoughts over a text editor. But we’ll have to wait and see if that will end up being the case.
