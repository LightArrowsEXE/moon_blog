An important aspect of translation involves editing the text to make it more accessible to those who speak the target language. This may involve various changes from localisation, rewriting jokes, or making dialogue come across more naturally. These guidelines are what we (and with that I mean "I") use when editing under Kaleido-subs. They are by no means a be-all, end-all set of rules, but will hopefully function well as a base for aspiring editors, as well as prove useful to quality control to ensure our subtitles meet a consistent editing standard.

Before we start, however, it's very important to note one thing: Depending on the project you work on, you may have to flip some rules on its head. Not every project is going to play out the same way and require the same kind of attention. Sometimes you *do* want specific pieces of dialogue to sound stilted or otherwise boring, or for far more literal translations to persevere over liberal ones. Sometimes you barely need to change anything at all! Don't be inflexible and perfectly adhere to a set of rules if the project requires you to change things up.


## Basic Use of English

We primarily stick with British English when editing. Below is a quick overview of the six most well-known differences:

* "fantasise", "apologise", "organise", "recognise"\*
* "colour", "favour", "humour", "rumour" (vs. "color", "favor", "humor", "rumor")
* "centre", "theatre", "metre", "calibre" (vs. "center", "theater"\*\*, "meter", "caliber")
* "travelling", "fuelling", "cancelled", marvelling" (vs. "traveling", "fueling", "canceled", "marveling")
* "defence", "offence", "licence", "pretence" (vs. "defense", "offense", "license", "pretense")
* "analogue", "dialogue", "prologue", "travelogue" (vs. "analog", "dialog", "prolog", "travelog")

\* "-ize" is also correct in British English, but required in American English. Whichever you use, stay consistent.<br>
\*\* "theatre" is technically also correct in American English.

Double quotation marks are to be used when quoting, and single marks used for quotes within a quote. Punctuation that is not part of the quote should remain outside the quotation marks, and the first word of a quoted sentence should always start with a capital letter, regardless of where in the sentence it starts.

* "January 10th. Lady Tamayo was ethereal and gorgeous again today."
* What do you mean, "I don't know where they went"?!
* And so he went all "Oh yeah, the guy said 'Just leave it all to me!' so nonchalantly!"

"Alright" should always be spelled as "all right". While they can be used interchangeably sometimes, "all right" is *always* correct.<br>
"OK", "Ok", and "ok" should always be written full-out as "okay".

Proper use of punctuation is *always* required. Be it periods, exclamation points, commas, semi-colons, whatever. Use whatever is most appropriate.

* Be careful not to spam too many commas. It's very easy to introduce a comma splice, so try to avoid that.
* That said, we're big lovers of the Oxford comma, so use it.
* Avoid ellipses like the plague. Oftentimes they're just annoying and unnecessary.
* We do not make use of four-dotted ellipsis. No matter your excuse, I won't allow it.
* No double-hyphens. When a script uses double-hyphens, replace them with em-dashes.
* Interrobangs are always written out as "?!". No "!?'s".
* No brackets unless you're feeling particularly memey.

Abbreviated titles are the only exception to the "British English always" rule. We prefer them with a period;

* "Mr." (vs. "Mr")
* "Dr." (vs. "Dr")

Keep the difference between "Ms.", "Miss", and "Mrs." in mind. "Miss" is a respectful way to refer to an unmaried woman, "Mrs." is for married or widowed women, and "Ms." is for when you're unsure, and generally the safest bet. If a character is often the butt of a joke concerning marriage/dating, you should probably be using "Miss" rather than "Ms.". If it's unknown to some characters that another woman is married, use "Ms." and switch over to "Mrs." when they learn of it.

Numbers are written fully whenever reasonable, and if the CPS allows for it. This does not extend to dates.<br>
Dates should also always use the British date format.

* "Thirty-six" (vs. "36")
* "Nine-hundred-ninety-one" (vs. "991")
* "Stop right there, Misaka 9982!" (vs. "Stop right there, Misaka nine-thousand-nine-hundred-eighty-two!")
* "The 25th of December, 1998" (vs. "The twenty-fifth of December, nineteen-ninety-eight")

## Dialects and Manners of Speech

Character speech is often informal and colloquial. This means they use contractions, often keep wording simple, etc. Make sure you render lines to sound as a natural English speaker would say them, unless a character is specifically noted to be speaking very formally and "properly", or different in general. The same holds true for archaic language, as well as dialects. However, in those cases localising them might hamper editing instead. Whether to translate them or render them as "normal accents" will depend on the context and how confident you are doing so.

Occasionally you will have characters making "hesitating noises". For example, "Uh...", "Ah...", "Uhm..." or stutters. These can often be omitted, but sometimes it may be preferable to keep them. No matter what you do, it's a good idea to let your timer know, or if you can time yourself, to retime the lines to make sure it also includes these noises.

For stutters, always capitalise the first letter if the stutter is at the start of the sentence, and make sure you repeat the initial sound. In practise this basically means you only ever end up repeating an additional "h" if present.

* "S-Scary? In wh-what way?"
* "Th-That's..."
* "I-It's bloody f-freezing out here!"

The Japanese *do*, in fact, know how to swear. As such, swears should be included if it makes sense for the characters to be using them. If you have someone that's an angry ass, it's fine to portray them as an angry ass.

## Localisation vs. Literalisation

Literalisation is always a fun topic to explore for fansubs. That said, we are fairly strict on our policies, and you are always expected to localise within reason unless the translator specifically doesn't want some things localised. That said, the dialogue should read as smoothly as it is intended to be heard by the original Japanese viewer. This means no "It can't be helped's" (unless it can't be helped). Edit it so it flows as smoothly as can be in English, i.e. "I had no choice", "It's no use", or "Shit happens". Names can be in either Western or Eastern order, so long as you make sure you're consistent.

Jokes should always be rewritten to work in English while ideally also retaining the spirit of the original joke.<br>
Absolutely no TL notes should remain unless there's absolutely 100% no way around it, but that should basically never be the case.

If a sentence reads awkwardly, rewrite it to retain the original meaning or point the sentence was meant to get across, while ensuring the sentence sounds like something a native English speaker would say. This isn't limited to single lines, either. If lines can be reasonably reordered to sound better, that should also be under consideration.

A lot of words tend to get repeated in the original Japanese lines. Translate them differently for some variety if it makes sense to, or else you'll end up with a boring and repetitive script. I don't want to see "idiot" every single time I hear "baka". Throw in a "moron", "dumbass", or "shit for brains" in there. Naturally, the same occurs in English too, especially when characters are speaking of a specific subject. Keep these in mind, and alternate your word use to keep the script fresh.

From my experience, in Japanese you hear names far more often than in English. You don't need to write the name every single time it's said in the Japanese dialogue, often a simple "you", "he", "they", etc. will suffice and come off more naturally. Rather, I'd even say that in some contexts it's a downright translation error *not* to go with "you".

Honorifics, bar special exceptions or translators actively pushing to retain them, are to be eradicated from the script. Replace them as necessary, or omit them if using an English honorific wouldn't make sense (so don't have high schoolers call each other "Mr." or "Ms."). If including English titles and the like starts sounding awkward, consider rewriting the sentence so it does work or just ditching them.

You might occasionally run into full-on English sentences, especially in songs. If you're not planning on memeing it and translating it back into Japanese, you should edit it so the sentence makes sense in actual English. I don't care how "good" the original English is, if the grammar is off at any point, fix it.

Keep an eye out for wasei-eigo. It's very easy to fall into a pitfall trap when listening to the English words Japanese people say directly rather than recognise what they actually mean. Take for example "tension". In Japanese, "tenshon" (テンション) is often used to describe a more energetic and fun atmosphere, while in English it usually means the opposite; it describes a more anxious atmoshere. It's important to keep these in mind while editing, since while it's the translator's job to translate those properly, it's also easy to miss sometimes. [Here][wasei_eigo] is a list of common wasei-eigo terms and their meanings.

Japanese attack names and similar cases where the original Japanese may be kept should ideally be localised whenever possible. Exceptions may include something like a Japanese character in an otherwise foreign setting, where him being Japanese gets continually played up. Use common sense.

## Formatting

Italics are used for inner monologue and emphasis on specific words and/or phrases. Flashbacks should not be italicised unless the preceding lines before it were also clearly part of an internal monologue. If a character is clearly speaking out loud in said flashback, remove the italics. They are also not used for characters that speak off-screen through some form of long-distance communication, like phone conversations or radio messages. If only the final (few) word(s) in a sentence is italicised, do not italicise the punctuation after it.

If necessary, subtitles should display at the top of the screen (done through the \an8 Aegisub tag). This is usually done for background conversation, or if there's too many lines on-screen concurrently. Lines that overlap should be properly styled so people don't get confused while reading them. Included in most Kaleido .ASS files is an "Alt" style that changes the border colour to dark blue. If necessary, use those or \an8 the subs.

Linebreaks should be set at natural breaks in a line. This usually means after commas, or between more natural points in a sentence. Absolutely *no* Daiz linebreaks, and absolutely *no* three-liners. Linebreaks are done using the \N tag in Aegisub.

* Miss Tamayo, once someone has become a demon, \Nis there a way to restore their humanity again?
* Then take this. It's been quite a while \Nsince I used the power of my eyes.
* Under-handed? You ronin of Mibu \Nare the real under-handed bunch!

When breaking lines, if the style is not set to "No word wrapping, both \n and \N break", set a \q2 tag at the start of every line with a linebreak. This forces players to not automatically wrap words in those lines, which can prevent nasty three-liners from popping up where we don't want them.

Interruptions should always use em-dashes. No hyphens. If your font doesn't support em-dashes, you can change the horizontal scaling with \fscx. \fscx250 is typically good enough.

## Other things of note

Keeping a styleguide per show is always a great idea. You might know what words, terminology, etc. you're using while you're editing it now, but you must also think about the you in the future, as well as anyone performing quality control over your script. This can also help set up "rules" that you can reference to again at a later date. Don't underestimate how useful these are!

Read, read, *READ*! The best way to improve your vocabulary and improve your creative writing is by reading more fiction. If you have time, pick up a book or watch a Western show to help improve your grasp of English, and make your writing sound more natural.

You should recognise what exactly you're editing. If you're reading this, you're probably an anime fansub editor. This means you've got far more limits than you do with, say, light novels. Know the limits of translating the medium, but don't be daunted by them. It being an anime shouldn't become an excuse to churn out poor scripts, but rather an opportunity to test yourself and overcome the limitations it presents or make full use of its strengths.

Keep the characters-per-second in mind. The redder the number is, the harder it tends to be to read. Safe values typically range from 11 to 15 CPS, but readability can be good enough at higher CPS's depending on linebreaks and words used. Rule of thumb should be to split the line so all the text is more centred if the CPS is roughly 18 or higher, and if the line is long enough to do so.

We should only ever require two styles for dialogue, this being a "Default" style and an "Alt" style. There is also a generic "Sign" style. You can grab all three styles from any Kaleido release. Chances are you're probably using Crunchyroll as a base, and they love spamming styles, so remove all of them and replace them with the three aforementioned styles in the Style Manager.

Similarly, it's a good idea to get rid of Crunchyroll's linebreaks, as they actively get in the way while editing. A simple Find & Replace will usually suffice, or you can use a tool called "Script Cleanup".

Every editor has a different style and set of rules they follow. This is simply mine, and what I expect the editors in Kaleido to uphold whenever reasonable. We could all stand to learn and improve our written English by absorbing as many different styles and, with time, developing our own. Whether or not you agree with my style, I hope this gave you some food for thought, and an insight into how I edit.

Here's a couple of useful resources and styleguides, of which I've used some as reference while writing this one. I guess I'll keep that updated as I find more stuff.
