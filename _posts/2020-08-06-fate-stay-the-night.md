If there's one thing that annoys me most above all else, it's people complaining about how hard it is to get into the Fate Series. Wait, hold on, scratch that—It's people giving poor recommendations for how to get into the Fate Series. And so, I figured I'd chime in and try to write a comprehensive list of the different areas of Fate, how to get into them, what order to watch stuff in, etc. I will also include links to database entries of every entry to help make it a bit easier to track on your lists, as well as recommend releases to watch.

## Fate/Know Thy Enemy

It is important to sort out some key basic knowledge first: The Fate Franchise is typically split into two parts: "Main Fate" and "Every Other Fate".

"Main Fate" consists of Fate/stay night, Fate/hollow ataraxia, and Fate/Zero, and should ideally be watched/read before anything else. "Every Other Fate" typically relies on you knowing at least Fate/stay night's lore, but may also contain deeper implications concerning Fate/Hollow Ataraxia or Fate/Zero.

The plot of Fate/stay night covers the Fifth Holy Grail War, a bloody battle to the death. Seven Heroic Spirits, henceforth called "Servants", are summoned by seven Masters, and they must fight in a battle royale for the grand prize; the Holy Grail, said to be able to grant any wish. In Fate/stay night, we follow Shirou Emiya, a rookie mage (if you can even call him that) who accidently ends up summoning Saber, a Servant. He quickly finds himself allying Rin Tohsaka, the Master of Archer.

Fate/stay night is built up out of three main routes, those being the following:

* FATE
* Unlimited Blade Works
* Heaven's Feel

FATE's heroine is Saber, Shirou Emiya's Servant.<br>
Unlimited Blade Works (abbrev: UBW)'s heroine is Rin Tohsaka, Archer's Master.<br>
Heaven's Feel (abbrev: HF)'s heroine is Sakura Matou, a close friend of Shirou.

## Fate/Goose-foot Conundrum

The biggest issue I often find when listening to people's recommendations is that there's a multitude of ways to approach the Fate Series. The following three are the most commonly named orders:

* **The OG Route:** Reading the source material in order of release
* **The Anime Route:** Watching the anime adaptations in the source order
* **The Chrono-Anime Route:** Watching the anime in chronological order of release

#### The OG Route

The OG route involves reading the source material in order of release, as it was intended to be read.

1) [Fate/stay night visual novel][fsn_vn]
2) [Fate/Hollow Ataraxia's visual novel][fha_vn]
3) [Fate/Zero's light novel][fz_ln]/[anime][fz_anime]

It's often encouraged to watch ufotable's fantastic anime adaptation of Fate/Zero over reading it, but I would suggest reading the final few chapters of the Light Novel after to catch a few scenes the anime skipped.

#### The Anime Route

The Anime Route branches out into two sub-routes:

* The ufotable Experience
    1) [Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (ufotable anime adaptation)][fsn_anime_ubw]
    2) [Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel (ufotable anime adaptation)][fsn_anime_hf]<br>
    2.5) [Fate/Hollow Ataraxia's visual novel][fha_vn]
    3) [Fate/Zero (ufotable anime adaptation)][fz_anime]
* The """Full""" Experience
    1) [Fate/stay night (Deen anime adaptation)][fsn_anime_06]
    2) [Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (ufotable anime adaptation)][fsn_anime_ubw]
    3) [Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel (ufotable anime adaptation)][fsn_anime_hf]<br>
    3.5) [Fate/Hollow Ataraxia's visual novel][fha_vn]
    4) [Fate/Zero (ufotable anime adaptation)][fz_anime]

The important distinction between these two orders is that the "full" experience includes the 2006 Fate/stay night adaptation by studio Deen, whereas the ufotable experience does not.

There's multiple arguments for either watch order. For the "full" experience, you will get a taste of the FATE route, which has never seen a proper adaptation. However, I wouldn't personally recommend going for that. The Deen adaptation is *not* a FATE adaptation; it's an adaptation of all three routes. It mixes and blends parts together to form it's own semi-route, which I don't think is really good and will just wind up spoiling parts of other routes.

FATE's route covers important aspects concerning both Shirou's and Saber's character, so while it's unfortunate that it has never gotten a proper adaptation, the truly necessary info from it gets covered partially by both the ufotable adaptation of UBW and the Fate/Zero adaptation, with it being an exercise to the viewer to connect the dots themselves where necessary.

If you're an aspiring anime-only, I would definitely recommend just sticking to the ufotable adaptations. If you enjoyed the Fate/stay night anime, however, I would highly recommend reading Fate/hollow ataraxia before you watch Fate/Zero, as it has yet to receive an anime adaptation but contains a lot of information that is detrimental to fully understanding Fate/Zero's finale.

#### The Chrono-Anime Route

This is an alternative method of viewing the anime. While the previous order still follows the original order that the source material was released in, this route instead follows the chronological order of events in the series itself:

1) [Fate/Zero (ufotable anime adaptation)][fz_anime]
2) [Fate/stay night (Deen anime adaptation)][fsn_anime_06]
3) [Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (ufotable anime adaptation)][fsn_anime_ubw]
4) [Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel (ufotable anime adaptation)][fsn_anime_hf]<br>
4.5) [Fate/Hollow Ataraxia's visual novel][fha_vn]

With this order, you'll be watching the main Fate series in chronological order. Fate/Zero covers the Fourth Holy Grail War, the war fought before the one in Fate/stay night. Now, this is not a route I would recommend, and the reason is simple: Fate/stay night and Fate/Zero spoil each other. Fate/stay night spoils parts of the finale (and mostly the finale only), but Fate/Zero spoils large parts of every single Fate/stay night route, *especially* Heaven's Feel. That said, if you really hate being in the dark about topics and revelations that get eluded to later in the time line, it's not the absolute worst way to go. I would still skip the Deen anime no matter what, though.

## Fate/Route Resolution

These are the three main orders to go in. Personally, my recommendation would always be to go with the source material if you want to enter Fate. Not only will it help condition you for the other Fate entries (as not everything has gotten an anime adaptation, and I really hope it stays that way, personally), but in my opinion the anime adaptations (bar Fate/Zero's) do a tremendously poor job of getting across Fate/stay night's true strength: its themes of heroism and what it means to revel in it or discard it. The anime does my boy Shirou pretty dirty, as [this][shirou_yt] video does a fairly good job of explaining (be aware, it spoils fairly heavily). If you still really want to not touch anything except for anime, I would recommend going with the second order. In my honest opinion, you lose out on a lot more hype by watching it in the chronological order, so I wouldn't recommend going that way.

No matter which order you're going with, these are the releases I would recommend for viewing:

**Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works:**
Either Aomundsen if you're on AnimeBytes, or [Kametsu][nyaa_fsn_ubw] if you're only on public trackers.

**Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel:**
[daraku][nyaa_fsn_hf_daraku] for the first movie. There are no good subs for the second movie yet at the time of writing, and the third movie hasn't come out yet. I'd recommend [SCY][nyaa_fsn_hf_scy] once he finds a translator that's willing to do an original translation, otherwise I'd say you should sit out until there's good subs (avoid the official subs like the plague).

**Fate/Zero:**<br>
[SCY's release][nyaa_fz], hands down.

**Fate/stay night (2006):**<br>
[THORA][nyaa_fsn_06]. This show doesn't really have any good releases either, and that's probably never gonna change.

**Fate/stay night (visual novel):**<br>
[This][nyaa_fsn_vn] anonymous release of Réalta Nua, pre-patched. The existing translations aren't particularly amazing, but servicable.

**Fate/hollow ataraxia (visual novel):**<br>
[supereImo's release][nyaa_fha_vn]. The state of this translation is much worse than Fate/stay night's, but again, it's servicable. I hope both get a great translation one day, though.

**Fate/Zero (light novel):**<br>
[meep's release][nyaa_fz_ln]. Sources are, unfortunately, unknown.

## Fate/wait, there's more...?

After you've watched the Main Fate series, basically every other Fate work is open to you. There is no real order to watch these in (outside of orders specifically tied to every entry), so you can enjoy them however you want. A few quick recommendations from me would be to check out Fate/Grand Order (mobage), Fate/EXTRA (game), Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya (Anime/Manga), and Fate/strange fake (Light Novel). Anything is open to you, so no matter what you choose to watch, I hope you enjoy it.

Also here's an obligatory *"now that wasn't so hard, was it?"*
