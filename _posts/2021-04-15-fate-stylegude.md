*This styleguide was last updated on 15/04/2021.*

This is the Kaleido styleguide for editing and localising the Fate franchise. This is the document we refer to internally while working on Nasuverse titles as a whole, and is not actually limited to Fate/stay night and its many sequels, prequels, spin-offs, or adaptations, even if only "Fate" is mentioned. These are also not intended to be hard rules, and translators and editors are free to discard certain "rules" if they deem it in the best interest of the end result to do so.

Furthermore, any other party is free to make use of this styleguide for their own releases. The sooner we can all wind up using a solid base, the better it will be for all anime viewers. Contributions/discussion can take place in the Kaleido Discord (link found on the official site), or in the Issues of this blog's GitHub repository.

This styleguide will continually be updated as we work on more Fate entries and adjustments need to be made, or new terminology/character voices added, and as such is by no means complete as it is right now. If you run into a keyword or rule that is absent from this styleguide, it is up to your own judgment to decide what call to make. Channels are always open for discussion.

## Basic English

All Fate works will be written in primarily **American English**. Exceptions may be made for settings that take place in Great Britain or features many British characters. In such situations, their lines will be edited in **British English**.

To name some examples:

* Fate/stay night: American English (Exceptions: Saber, British English)
* Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya: American English
* Lord El-Melloi II: British English

No real exceptions are made yet for other English dialects like Canadian or Australian English, but if characters from those regions crop up, it is assumed they will be edited in the relevant dialect.

**Italicization** is used for internal monologues and emphasis. This does not extend to off-screen speakers, speeches in flashbacks that are spoken out loud in said flashbacks, or communication devices.

Remember that speech is something **for the ear**, and should be written as such. It is great to write grammatically correct sentences, but humans don't always speak grammatically sound. Sometimes they slur certain phrases, sometimes they combine words in weird ways—Keep this in mind while writing dialogue.

Do not blindly take over spoken **onomatopoeia**. Describe them instead. It is much more common in Japanese to say "kira kira" than it is to say "sparkle sparkle" in English. Instead, we would say something like "That's so pretty", for example.

A common occurance in the Fate series will be the use of **Middle English** or other archaic uses. Many Servants are summoned from very long-gone time periods, so it is not uncommon for part of their character speech to include such language. However, **readability** comes before fanciness. When using Middle English, make sure it is ultimately still readable to adept Modern English speakers.

Finally, the Nasuverse is a very **chuuni** setting. As such, it is expected that not all dialogue will flow naturally and may be exaggerated more than usual to get across a specific effect. The same rule applies as with Middle English: Make sure it is ultimately readable and understandable to adept Modern English speakers.

## Localization

**Honorifics**, divisive as they are, are used in our translations for this series. However, they come with caveats:

* Characters who would naturally not use Japanese honorifics will drop them in our translations. This would be for example foreign characters who only speak Japanese for the convenience of it in the current work.
* Certain exceptions may be made if a character is not Japanese but is deeply ingrained into their culture or has spoken it for most of their lives. An example of this would be Mash Kyrielight.

There are certain edgecases to also consider. For example, in our Fate/stay night translation, we do not have Illya use honorifics. We translate "Onii-chan" as "Mister". However, in Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, Illya grows up in Japan. Therefore, in that series, we would preserve her honorifics.

Below is a list of common translations/localizations of certain honorifics:

* Illya: Onii-chan ("Mister" in Fate/stay night, "Onii-chan" in Fate/Kaleid)

Besides these examples, honorific localization can be tackled in any number of ways that best results in a natural script, and it's up to the editor to figure out how to accomplish that.

**Name order** is always the spoken order. This is sometimes inconsistent in the franchise itself however, so you should be extra mindful of it. For example, "Fujimaru Ritsuka" and "Mash Kyrielight" are both spoken name orders in Fate/Grand Order.

With certain characters come more excentric **character voice**. Not every character is going to speak the same way, and it is vital to a well-flowing translation that this is conveyed properly. Remember that people also aren't robots. They don't always fully convey a line in one shot. They may stumble over or try to find certain words. How this is handled is largely up to the translator and editor to decide on a case-by-case basis, but it is important to look back at previous works whenever possible to see how those voices were handled for consistency.

## Addendum

This styleguide is by no means finalized. The Nasuverse is an ever-growing franchise, and we have yet to tackle many of its entries. If you see anything that appears to be completely off or wrong, please don't hesitate to join the Kaleido Discord server and let us know.
